I created this project to understand the basic concepts of Compiler Design using the C programming language. It includes simple programs that demonstrate how different stages of a compiler work, such as identifying grammar, handling expressions, and understanding input/output flow in a compiler-related environment. The code is written using standard C libraries and is structured clearly using functions. I used the Clang compiler on macOS to compile and run the programs through the terminal. For writing and organizing my code, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with C extension support. This project helped me build a strong foundation in how compilers process source code, especially from a student and beginner perspective.
